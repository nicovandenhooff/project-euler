# Project Euler

A repository that contains my solutions to a selection of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems, written in Python.  

As I'm in the field of data science, I opt to try to use [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) as much as possible in my solutions.

## Solutions

This folder contains python files for each solution.

## Data

This folder contains any files required for a given solution.
